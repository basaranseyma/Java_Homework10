# Grade Calculator 
This Java program is an assignment for [Patika.dev](https://patika.dev) and serves as a simple grade calculator that helps users determine whether they have passed or failed a class based on their grades in five different subjects: Math, Physics, Turkish, Chemistry, and Music. The program prompts the user to input their grades for each subject, ensuring that each grade entered is between 0 and 100. If a grade outside this range is entered, the program provides an error message and terminates.

Upon successful entry of all grades within the valid range, the program calculates the average grade of the user across all subjects. If this average is 55 or below, indicating a failing grade, the user is informed of their failure. Otherwise, they are congratulated for passing the class. The program provides the calculated average grade to the user as the final output.
